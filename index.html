        Hi! I'm Caiden, a student and aspiring full stack developer. This
        website is where I put my ongoing/completed projects and portfolio,
        along with some of my friend's projects. All of them are open source and
        available on my
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/caiden-kim"
          ><u>github</u></a
        >. Everything I make for my website can be downloaded off of my github and 
        run locally in your browser by opening the "index.html" file.
        If you want to contact me, my socials are linked below. Have a good
